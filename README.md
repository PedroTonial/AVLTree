# AVLTree and Binary Search Trees (BST) - Algorithm and data structure class

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of AVL Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST) in JAVA. It includes functionalities for insertion, deletion, and searching in both tree structures, with AVL Tree offering additional self-balancing features.

## Introduction

Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL Trees are fundamental data structures used in various computer science applications. A BST is a tree structure where each node has at most two children and follows the left child < parent < right child property. An AVL Tree is a self-balancing BST that maintains a balance factor to ensure O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

## Features

- **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Search
  - In-order, Pre-order, Post-order Traversal

- **AVL Tree:**
  - Insertion (with self-balancing)
  - Deletion (with self-balancing)
  - Search
  - In-order, Pre-order, Post-order Traversal
